# Vendor API

This is a python script that will allow the user to automate getting Vendor updates, adding notes to tickets, and closing tickets. It is designed for RT

2 configuration files are available. Credentials need to be put in them.

## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Basic Usage

```
python 3vendor_api.py 
```


Ideally, RT's process will go like this:
1. Cron every x minutes (x probably = 5): >$ python 3vendor_api.py
2. Tickets will automatically be generated by the rt module
3. The RT perl scrips that I wrote into our RT Extension will communicate back to vendor

## Details

The program goes like this
1. Get all updates from vendor
2. Process each update and create dictionary of tickets including relevant fields
3. Create a Ticket object for every ticket that has updates
4. Either create a new ticket in RT or update current one
